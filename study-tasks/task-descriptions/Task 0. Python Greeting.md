# Task 0: Python Greeting (Demonstration Example)

**You have 5 minutes start from now to complete the following tasks.**

## Background

This is a simple Python program that greets the user. We use it to demonstrate how to use the two prompting techniques to modify the code.

## Modification Requirements

*The reference code location is provided in parentheses for your reference.*

**1. Empty Name Handling** (`greet_user` function)
- If the user enters an empty name, the program should notify the user about the emptiness, and prompt again to enter their name.

**2. Multiple Greetings** (`greet_user` function)
- Add a `times` parameter to control the number of greetings, with a default value of three.
